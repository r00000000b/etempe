UK Government’s Cyber Security Advice For Businesses
----------------------------------------------------

The UK government’s National Technical Authority for Information Assurance (CESG) recommends organisations implement the following IT network security measures to prevent cyberattacks:

NETWORK SECURITY
Protect your networks against external and internal attack. Manage the network perimeter. Filter out unauthorised access and malicious content. Monitor and test security controls.

INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
Establish an incident response and disaster recovery capability. Produce and test incident management plans. Provide specialist training to the incident management team. Report criminal incidents to law enforcement.

SECURE CONFIGURATION
Apply security patches and ensure that the secure configuration of all ICT systems is maintained. Create a system inventory and define a baseline build for all ICT devices.

MONITORING
Establish a monitoring strategy and produce supporting policies. Continuously monitor all ICT systems and networks. Analyse logs for unusual activity that could indicate a cyberattack.

Corporate cybercrimes surge to 59 million in 2015, but could be fraction of true figure: PwC survey
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The incidence of cybercrimes has jumped from fourth to second place among the most-reported types of economic crime, according to the ‘Global Economic Crime Survey 2016’ by PwC.

“While over a quarter of respondents said they had been affected by cybercrime, 18 per cent told us they didn’t know if they had. And due to the stealthy nature of these crimes, many of the 56 per cent who said they weren’t affected may well have been compromised without ever knowing it.”

“Corporate cybercrime has seen double-digit growth over the last five years. Breaches originating from cloud-connected devices jumped by 152 per cent in 2015 compared to a year earlier,” the authors of the survey highlight. “And cybercrime losses can be heavy. Seven per cent are greater than US$1 million.”

It continues, “Only 37 per cent of the surveyed organisations have a cyber incident response plan. And when an attack does occur, too often organisations seem to be leaving the first response to their IT departments, without adequate intervention or support from senior management.”

Another PwC study, the ‘Global State of Information Security Survey 2016,’ states that “the number of 2015 corporate cybercrime incidents stands at 59 million – most likely a fraction of the true figure.”
