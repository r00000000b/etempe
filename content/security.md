Four members of alleged securities fraud scheme tied to cyber hack of JP Morgan arrested in US, Israel
------------------------------------------------------------------------

US law enforcement authorities have arrested four people in Israel and Florida in connection with a “complex securities fraud scheme” tied to the computer hacks at JP Morgan Chase and other financial institutions, reported Bloomberg in a breaking news TV report in July 2015.

“Officials say a fifth person remains at large and the arrests are the culmination of a months-long investigation of several friends who met more than a decade ago at Florida state university, and are linked by an FBI memo to one of the largest US bank hacks.”

The presenter likened the case to a, “Modern computer crime. Two former college buddies (linked) to a multi-layered criminal organisation with tentacles reaching Moscow, Tel Aviv and West Palm Beach.”

Bloomberg News reporter, Keri Geiger, said from New York, “It appears to be a criminal enterprise. The people arrested today were not arrested for the hack of JP Morgan. Some of them were arrested for setting up a “pump and dump” scheme (of low volume, penny stocks) with the aid of information related, or linked, to various hacks, and going in, getting information from banks.”

Earlier a US government spokesman announced at a press conference that hackers stole US$83 million from JPMorgan Chase and data from 100 million customers.

“The charges involve cyber intrusions over several years, targeting 12 different companies, seven financial institutions, two financial news publications, two software development firms and a market risk intelligence company,” the spokesman said.

“Defendants allegedly stole personal information from over 100 million customers, including 83 million customers from one bank alone. The single largest theft of customer data from a US financial institution ever. That bank was JP Morgan Chase, and it has disclosed itself.”

The spokesman added, “Sophisticated hacking to steal material non-public information is something the defendants allegedly discussed for the next stage of their sprawling criminal enterprise.”
