Penetration Tests & Intrusion
-----------------------------

Penetration Testing is the practice of testing a computer system, IT network or Web applications to find vulnerabilities that a hacker could exploit to gain, for example, unauthorized access to an organisation’s data.

Eagle Eye Systems Asia Ltd conducts Penetration Tests as an integral part of its Baseline Methodology Assessment for Cyber Security & Risk Mitigation, although, it can be provided as a standalone service.

Penetration testing is conducted at a skill level higher than that of the general Internet user. Our cyber security experts use a combination of industry testing products and our own methodology to determine vulnerabilities and the defence capabilities of an IT network.

The other main objectives of penetration testing are to determine an organisation’s ability to identify and respond to security breaches, and test for security policy compliance and employees’ security awareness.

The penetration test results are then reported back to the client.

'Coverage' & 'Impact' Testing
-----------------------------

The process involves gathering information about the target company before the penetration test is carried out (reconnaissance), identifying possible entry points, and simulating a hostile attempt to break into an IT network, either virtually or for real, as part of ‘Coverage’ and ‘Impact’ testing.

EES Asia advocates ‘Impact’ testing as an alternative to the standard ‘Coverage’ penetration test, and whilst the ‘Coverage’ test is no less important, the ‘Impact’ test has a far greater reach and replicates a real-life scenario where a company is open to attack in their normal business operations.

All tests are conducted under controlled conditions in accordance with the recommendations outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the US Department of Commerce, NIST SP 800-1151.

Dashboard: Interactive Gauges & Scorecard
-----------------------------------------

The Scorecard is a key Baseline Methodology Assessment tool for determining a business’s vulnerability status for Cyber Security & Risk Mitigation.

An organisation is rated out of 100 points across seven vertical segments.

The scorecard includes an explanation of how the company’s final score has been calculated by our cyber security experts.

Certification
-------------

Eagle Eye Systems Asia Ltd offers Certification of Achievement Awards for a select number of essential skills or services demanded by best practice policies and procedures within the IT industry, with the assistance of skilled and experienced industry instructors.

Social Engineering
------------------

The hard core aspect of the penetration tests is “Social Engineering.” It is deployed to uncover employee passwords by tracing their activity online and on social media networks, to find out personal information, such as, the names of their children, birthdates and pet names—all of which are commonly used in passwords. Likewise, a hacker could work out their passwords to break into a company’s IT network.

“Social Engineering” is defined as any act that influences people to respond in a way that is not in their best interest, using psychological, physiological and technological techniques, and often with malicious intent.

Social engineering tactics are considered to be the “greatest risk to information security,” states Social-Engineer.org on its website, whose infographic shows the top three methodologies of malicious social engineering.
