Security & Network Operations Centre (SOC/NOC)
----------------------------------------------

24/7 monitoring is a major focus of Eagle Eye Systems Asia Ltd’s Information Security Operations Centre (SOC) and Network Operations Centre (NOC). The two facets complement each other and work in tandem. Together, the centre monitors, assesses and defends the enterprise’s entire information system.

Given the sensitive nature of IT environments, we offer active, passive and host-­based technologies to specifically match the requirements of every IT network.

NOC is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the overall network infrastructure. Its primary function is to ensure uninterrupted network service.

SOC
---

The role of the SOC is to protect networks, as well as, web sites, applications, databases, servers and data centres, among other technologies and endpoints.

SOC is related to the people, processes and technologies involved in providing situational awareness through the detection, containment, and remediation of IT threats. A SOC manages incidents for the enterprise, ensuring they are properly identified, analyzed, communicated, actioned/defended, investigated and reported.

The SOC also monitors applications to identify a possible cyberattack or intrusion (event) and determine if it is a real and malicious threat (incident), and if it could have a business impact.

EES Asia has processes and procedures built into our SOC to clearly spell out the roles, responsibilities and monitoring procedures. They cover business, technology, operational and analytical processes. We lay out the steps to be taken in the event of an security alert or breach, such as escalation, reporting and breach response procedures.

Hack of toy maker VTech exposes 5 million accounts, kids’ photos & chats
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cyber hackers could find out the names, birthdays and where children with a VTech learning toy live, after the popular toy maker was hacked.

VTech said in a statement the hackers, “Exposed the names, emails, passwords, mailing addresses and download history for five million accounts. But it goes way beyond that. The hacker was also able to pull up the photos taken of kids and the parents, along with chats and audio recordings made with the kid connect service.”

“It appears VTech did not do enough to encrypt customer data and passwords to guard it from hackers,” said American Technology Journalist and host of the CNET update, Bridget Carey.

She continues, ”When you have company as big as VTech not doing the basics when it comes to security and protecting your data it should show you we have a huge cybersecurity problem on our hands. Companies need to invest in security before they get hacked not after.”
