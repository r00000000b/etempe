## The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) “Cybersecurity Fortification Initiative” (CFI) to help the city's banks reduce the vulnerability of their IT networks to data and assets theft by hackers is in keeping with the Baseline Methodology Assessment and Audit, Security Incidence Response, and IT Security Awareness Training pioneered in Hong Kong by cybersecurity experts at Eagle Eye Systems Asia Limited (EES).

The HKMA said it would issue a formal circular to all banks, setting out that it is a supervisory requirement for them to implement the CFI through a three-pronged approach.

“I think this initiative would mark a giant leap forwards for a number of reasons. Not least that the establishment of a central repository for anonymous reporting of cyberattacks would be highly beneficial for all parties involved, from the victims of the cyberattacks, to the regulators, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity experts who are there to prevent, and clean up after, cybercrime,” says Sunil Rathour, CEO of Eagle Eye Systems Asia Limited.

“The recommendation contained in the CFI to provide a framework to assess the security maturity of an organisation's IT network and the cyberattack risk follow the same principles laid out in our Baseline Methodology Assessment and Audit,” explains Rathour.

“We too encourage companies to implement security awareness training for all levels of staff, starting from the top down. Our customized workshops are designed to raise staff awareness about the risks that poor security standards represent to any enterprise.

“At EES we take this one step further by providing comprehensive and ongoing online security training programmes, to keep staff abreast of the evolving cybercrime eco-system, and to build on and reinforce their newly acquired knowledge and skills about how to reduce a company's risk of being attacked by the increasingly sophisticated legions of hackers worldwide.”

The launch of the government's new CFI programme follows hot on the heels of the multi-million dollar cyber heist unleashed on the Bangladesh central bank in February, in which cybercriminals raided a central bank account kept at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and stole US$81 million (HK$629 million), reported Reuters.

In the high profile cyberattack, malware was installed inside the bank’s Dhaka headquarters that hid traces of the criminal activity, in order to delay discovery and give the hackers ample time to access the funds.

The theft prompted fresh attacks on other central banks within the region, with Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank saying in mid-May that it had interrupted a similar attempted cyber heist.
