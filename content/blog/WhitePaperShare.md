## Eagle Eye Systems (EES) Asia Ltd has launched a new website to serve as an online platform for sharing IT security industry news, trends and concern topics, white papers, and independent expert advice to help educate enterprises and their employees about cyber security and how to prevent attacks.

"The idea is to point people in the right direction to expert information and independent reports that they may overlook as they may not be aware of the reputable sources of information available online because they lack  a deep understanding of the IT security industry," said Sunil Rathour, CEO, Eagle Eye Securities (EES) Asia.

"Cyber attacks are rising on a global scale at a dramatic rate. No company, no matter its size, is immune to hacks, even the likes of Apple and Linux, as the cyber criminals are becoming increasingly cunning and the attacks are becoming more difficult to detect. Many companies simply aren’t aware they’ve been hacked until months later," observed Sunil.

"Staff education is key. At the end of the day, a company is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest line of defence is an enterprise’s employees."

“The most effective approach is to train a business’s leadership first because enterprises need to put in place, for example, social media policies to govern how staff use social media networks at work, as well as password policies, to eliminate the risk of confidential company and client data being leaked in today’s digital world,” explains Sunil Rathour, CEO EES Asia.

>> "We decided to establish an IT Security Training Awareness division because organisations need help training their staff from the top down, to understand the risks associated with cybercrime and best practices, and introduce employees to cyber security tools." Sunil Rathour, CEO EES Asia.

The platform that forms a key part of the EES Asia’s revamped website coincides with the launch of a second additional core service: Security Incidence Response—a cost-effective solution for SMEs unable to hire their own IT security personnel.

A major aspect of EES Asia’s cyber security work is Baseline Methodology Assessment & Audit and the less comprehensive, albeit cheaper solution, Penetration Tests, that are specifically designed for SMEs to prevent cyber attacks and the associated loss of revenue and confidential data in order to protect a brand’s image and reputation.

About Eagle Eye Systems (EES) Asia

No cyber security firm in Hong Kong provides EES Asia’s Baseline Methodology Assessment & Audit to comprehensively assess Information Security Maturity by examining a company’s cyber security defences–and recommends improvements and solutions–despite the threat of cyber attacks having emerged worldwide with speed and ferocity.

This assessment is supported by Penetration Tests to probe a computer system, IT network or Web applications to identify vulnerabilities that a hacker could exploit to launch a cyber attack.

In the event of a business being attacked, EES Asia’s cyber security experts are on call 24/7 to provide immediate Security Incident Response, as well as monitor a business’s Information Technology assets 24/7 via our Security and Network Operations Centre.
