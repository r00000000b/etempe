## HONG KONG’s banking watchdog, the HK Monetary Authority, is calling on banks across the city to “step up security measures for online banking as soon as possible to protect the ­interest of customers,” after revealing it has received ­reports from banks about unauthorised stock trading activities, totalling HK$45.97 million, in at least 22 online bank accounts in at least four banks.

The authority also revealed there were nine cases that resulted in financial losses of HK$1.56 million, for which that banks have received compensation in full. In each case these incidents caused the stock price to go up after the unauthorised purchase of shares, reported the South China Morning Post.

“The measures recommended by the authority are only a small step in the right direction,” warns CEO Sunil Rathour of Hong Kong-based cybersecurity firm, Eagle Eye Systems Asia Limited. “Comprehensive protection from cyberattacks requires further action.”

The HKM is demanding banks offer customers the option to set a daily limit on the volume of Internet share trading transactions that can be performed over their accounts, and to remind customers to use difficult-to-guess passwords.

“To effectively protect their IT networks, banks must implement: two factor authentication, giving customers just three password attempts before being locked out of their security device; 24/7 security monitoring; a cybersecurity policy update; ongoing security awareness training for all levels of staff; and deploy a security incidence response team who can immediately respond to attacks or suspicious online activity.”

Rathour also advises banks to conduct a Baseline Methodology Assessment and Audit to specifically identify vulnerabilities in their IT networks, in order to harden potential attack surfaces. Servers need to be updated and strengthened by patching the operation system, programmes and applications.

“The fact that the banks have reported the hacks to the HKMA is admirable. And by not revealing the names of the banks targeted in the attacks to the media, it makes it more appealing for banks to report future hacks to the authority,” adds Rathour.

There were 11 million online bank accounts in Hong Kong in 2015, generating 17 million transactions worth HK$7.3 trillion on average per month, according to the HKMA’s records.
