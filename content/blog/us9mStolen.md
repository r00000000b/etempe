## TWENTY THREE companies registered in Hong Kong, some of which were hidden under the guise of shadowy shell companies, have been exposed for their involvement in the cyber theft by unidentified hackers of US$12 million from Ecuador’s Banco del Austro (BDA) in January 2015.

The previously unreported court filings by the BDA in Hong Kong’s Court of First Instance, as well as judicial rulings, embroil a web of companies that received or handled more than $9 million of the stolen funds, allegedly through the SWIFT global messaging system, which is used to move hundreds of billions of dollars and other currencies each day among commercial and central banks

Initially, the cyber criminals moved $9.139 million stolen from BDA into the Hong Kong accounts of four companies at HSBC and Hang Seng Bank, reported Reuters.

At least $3.1 million of the funds were then routed from those four companies to 19 “second layer” bank accounts, meaning the funds made a second hop to another set of Hong-Kong registered companies, the court papers show.

Hong Kong Deputy High Court Judge Conrad Seagroatt said in a December ruling in the case that the four initial recipients showed no prior history of business activity. “They all appear to be otherwise inactive corporate vehicles controlled by citizens of the People’s Republic of China,” Seagroatt wrote.

The paper trail left behind by $2 million stolen from the Ecuadorian bank runs cold to a former factory in Hong Kong’s Kwun Tong district, and to the registered address for Jiushun Group Co., Ltd.

Another Hong Kong company in the BDA case – Regal Prosper Trading Ltd – was set up by a woman who served as a director for 200 companies. Regal’s current director, Chen Jianan, listed a home address that does not exist in Hong Kong, according to company registry records.

According to Mike Kenealy, chief operating officer of risk and compliance consultancy Insiders Corp., the undemanding disclosure laws make Hong Kong attractive to money launderers.

“These companies are often set up for ill-gotten gains and as vehicles of corruption,” he said. “Once the money starts moving, it gets laundered, converted and disappears without a trace.”

A look at Jiushun Group shows how hard it can be to trace business activities and money flows in Hong Kong. Jiushun Group received $1.968 million wired from Ecuador, by way of the United States, according to the court filings.

But Jiushun’s corporate registry filings list the factory building game room as its office address. They disclose the name of only one director, Chen Sheng Rong, who could not be located for comment.

A Hong Kong High Court judge in the BDA case described Jiushun and three other companies as appearing to be inactive corporate vehicles controlled by Chinese citizens.

BDA has settled with or withdrawn claims against five of the companies involved, but not Jiushun.

In the Kwun Tong district, the web of Jiushun connections seems to expand from person to person and place to place – without offering many hints as to where the BDA money went.
