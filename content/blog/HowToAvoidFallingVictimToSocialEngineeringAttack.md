## Leading UK bank NatWest and parent, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group, are shoring up their Internet banking systems after security shortcomings were exposed by BBC journalists, who managed to “hijack” a colleague’s NatWest online bank account and transfer money without knowing her password.

The scam engineered for the banking giant’s customers deployed social engineering tactics, whereby the crook reports a victim’s mobile phone as lost or stolen to their mobile network, and asks for the victim’s phone number to be swapped over to the thief’s SIM.

>> “SIM swap fraud is an emerging issue across the industry, and we’re working closely with Financial Fraud Action UK and mobile phone providers to enhance our customer authentication processes as fraudsters become more sophisticated,” NatWest said in a statement in response to media enquiries.

Eagle Eye Systems (EES) Asia’s CEO, Sunil Rathour, advises the public to be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls, visits, or email messages from individuals asking for internal company or employee information. He recommends that companies try to verify an unknown individual’s association directly with their company, if the stranger claims to be from a legitimate organisation.

Second, do not provide personal information or information about your organisation, including its structure or networks, unless you are certain of a person’s authority to have such information.

Do not reveal personal or financial information by email, and do not respond to email solicitations for this information. This includes following website links sent in an email.

Again, don’t send sensitive information over the Internet before checking a website’s security.

Pay attention to the website address given by an unknown party. Malicious websites may look identical to a legitimate website, but the website address may use a variation in spelling or a different domain, for example, .com versus .net.

If you are unsure whether an email request is legitimate, try to verify it by contacting the company directly. Do not use the contact information provided on a website connected to the request. Instead, check previous statements for contact information. Information about known “phishing” attacks is also available online from groups such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group at:  www.antiphishing.org.

Install and maintain anti-virus software, firewalls, and email filters to reduce some of potentially malicious and fraudulent traffic.

Finally, take advantage of any anti-phishing features offered by your email client, such as Outlook or Thunderbird, and web browser.
