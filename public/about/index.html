<h1 id="about-us">About Us</h1>

<h2 id="raison-d-être">Raison d&rsquo;être</h2>

<p>No cyber security firm in Hong Kong provides our methodology to comprehensively assess a company’s IT security defences, despite the threat of cyber attacks having emerged worldwide with speed and ferocity. Hence, we’re here to give you peace of mind.</p>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<p>To bolster the cyber security defences of all types of businesses and recommend solutions to mitigate the risk of being hacked, resulting in the theft of confidential data, damage to reputation and financial losses.</p>

<h2 id="our-team">Our Team</h2>

<p>Our team of experts deliver cost-effective solutions with over 20 years of experience, specializing in cyber security.</p>

<h2 id="next-dimension-of-security-defences">Next Dimension of Security Defences</h2>

<p>IT security threats are sophisticated, cunning and everyone is a target not just high profile businesses.</p>

<p>“So far when businesses typically think of an attack, they think about how much time they are going to be knocked off line. And the clean-up cost—whether it’s technical or legal,” said Peter Singer, author of “Cybersecurity and Cyberwar,” and senior fellow at New America Foundation.</p>

<p>He was speaking in an interview with Bloomberg News in December 2014, to discuss the multi-million dollar attack on Sony Pictures that exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of people. Since this interview, “Sony Hacked: Three Lessons Learned for Corporations,” was released the situation has remained much the same.</p>

<p>The hackers realize that many companies are restrained by IT security costs spinning out of control, presenting an opportunity for hackers to target any business with financial assets, high risk data or confidential information that can be exploited. The hackers seek anonymity and fame by exposing weaknesses in IT Security &amp; Risk Mitigation.</p>

<p>No cyber security firm in Hong Kong provides our Baseline Methodology Assessment &amp; Audit to comprehensively assess Information Security Maturity by examining a company’s cyber security defences, and recommends improvements and solutions.</p>

<p>This assessment is supported by Penetration Tests to probe a computer system, IT network or Web applications to identify vulnerabilities that a hacker could exploit to launch a cyber attack.</p>

<p>In the event of a business being hacked, our cyber security experts are on call <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> to provide immediate Security Incident Response, as well as monitor a business’s Information Technology assets <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> via our Security and Network Operations Centre.</p>

<h2 id="experts-urge-enterprises-to-tighten-cyber-security-before-hack-not-focus-on-clean-up-job-afterwards">Experts urge enterprises to tighten cyber security before hack, not focus on clean-up job afterwards</h2>

<p>Organisations are being urged to address IT security issues, and abandon the traditional standpoint of waiting to be hacked before they act, to save money in the long run.</p>

<p>“So far when businesses typically think of an attack, they think about how much time they are going to be knocked off line. And the clean-up cost whether it’s technical or legal,” said Author of “Cybersecurity and Cyberwar” and Senior Fellow at New America Foundation, Peter Singer.</p>

<p>“What we are seeing from Sony is that all sorts of other costs kick in. Everything from impact on your brand to customers being upset with you and your business partners,” said Mr Singer, who was discussing the aftermath of the major cyberattack on Sony Pictures allegedly by North Korea in November 2014.</p>

<p>“It’s a lot more effective to focus on preventing and being resilient to the attacks then focussing on the clean up afterwards… The same argument can be said about fire or theft in general. If people think their way out of this is to hire crisis management or good PR they are setting themselves up for a world of hurt.”</p>

<p>The Sony hack cost the studio tens of millions of US dollars, revealed the personal information of tens of thousands of people, exposed embarrassing email exchanges between high-powered actors and executives, and one top executive lost her job, reported CNBC one year later.</p>
