<h1 id="baseline-methodology-assessment-and-audit">BASELINE METHODOLOGY ASSESSMENT AND AUDIT</h1>

<p>Main-Operation-Centre1024x845.jpg</p>

<h2 id="cyber-security-risk-mitigation-advanced-threat-solutions">Cyber Security, Risk Mitigation &amp; Advanced Threat Solutions</h2>

<p>Eagle Eye Systems Asia Limited’s advanced Baseline Methodology Assessment &amp; Audit solution has been developed after a decade of research and tests by IT Security and Risk Consultants, to achieve proven results.</p>

<p>This unique assessment involves systematic and theoretical analysis of a company’s IT network security. It is divided into nine models to ascertain how a network would react to a cyberattack.</p>

<p>We do not set out to provide solutions. Our Baseline Methodology Assessment report documents the findings of our investigation and presents recommendations and “best practices” applicable to specific areas where a company’s cyber security defences are deemed inadequate, or even non-existent.</p>

<p>network-to-server1024x845-1-1024x845.jpg</p>

<h2 id="risk-model">Risk Model</h2>

<p>Discovering vulnerabilities in an IT Network is important. By following Eagle Eye Systems Asia’s methodology, it is possible to estimate the severity of the risks to a business and make an informed decision to reduce the risks.</p>

<p>Early in the life cycle, security concerns may be identified in the architecture or design by using threat modelling. Thereafter, security issues using code review or penetration testing may be discovered, and sometimes after an application is compromised.</p>

<p>Failure to tighten cyber security defences may impact organisations in terms of: financial loss, damage to reputation, non-compliance, loss of accountability, privacy violation, loss of confidentiality, and may result in company being taken off-line.</p>

<p>Penetration-tests-wall-monitor1024x845.png</p>

<h2 id="dashboard-interactive-gauges-scorecard">Dashboard: Interactive Gauges &amp; Scorecard</h2>

<p>The Scorecard is a key Baseline Methodology Assessment tool for determining a business’s vulnerability status for Cyber Security &amp; Risk Mitigation.</p>

<p>An organisation is rated out of 100 points across seven vertical segments.</p>

<p>The scorecard includes an explanation of how the company’s final score has been calculated by our cyber security experts.</p>

<h2 id="it-network-infrastructure">IT Network Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Penetration Tests form the foundation of the IT network assessment. The duration of these tests depends on the number of IP Addresses and internal and external attack surfaces within an IT network that a hacker may exploit.</p>

<p>Personal-Cyber-Security1024x724.jpg</p>

<h2 id="attack-surface-analysis">Attack Surface Analysis</h2>

<p>As part of EES Asia’s holistic approach to assessment methodology, we review the security and defensibility of an organisation in a number of key areas, starting with an examination of both technical attack surfaces.</p>

<p>This includes the services presented; trusted ingress (inbound) traffic, and trusted egress (outgoing) traffic; and human attack surfaces, such as, corporate social media profile and employee’s social media activity.</p>

<p>Modern-Workplace1024x845.jpg</p>

<h2 id="network-systems-agility">Network &amp; Systems Agility</h2>

<p>Network &amp; Systems Agility focuses on an IT network’s ability to adapt to changing requirements that are not limited to the Information Security domain, but relate to commercial and organisational drivers, such as evolving business models and innovation cycles, and the changing requirements of the modern workplace.</p>

<p>An IT network’s oversight and maintenance, performance management, service level agreements, network survivability, and policy base are assessed.</p>

<p>An agile network &amp; systems model is predicated on the avoidance of “brittleness.” We use this term to refer to technical architecture or implementation that can withstand only a very limited attack prior to a failure affecting commercial operations, owing to the existence of an undefended core.</p>

<p>monitors-and-binary1024x845.png</p>

<h2 id="defensive-elements-layers">Defensive Elements &amp; Layers</h2>

<p>Defensive parameters focus on specific architectures, strategies, technologies and systems which offer a mitigation of addressable risk to meet an organisation’s requirements.</p>

<p>The presence, coverage and risk mitigation capability of each component in this methodology has been configured for individual requirements, and represents a best-common-practice approach.</p>

<p>Defensive Elements are the network, servers and clients, while the Defensive Layers are the perimeter, network, host, application and data.</p>

<p>Digital-Fingerprint1024x845.jpg</p>

<h2 id="identity-access-management-iam">Identity Access Management (IAM)</h2>

<p>Identity Access Management (IAM) is a framework for business processes that facilitates the management of electronic identities. The framework includes the technology needed to support identity management.</p>

<p>IAM technology can be used to initiate, capture, record and manage user identities and their related access permissions in an automated fashion. This ensures that access privileges are granted according to one policy interpretation, and all individuals and services are properly authenticated, authorized and audited.</p>

<p>Poorly controlled IAM processes may lead to regulatory non-compliance because if the organisation is audited, management will not be able to prove that company data is not at risk of being misused.</p>

<p>Authentication examines: account policy, password policy, and the authentication model.</p>

<p>National-Security-Agency.jpg</p>

<h2 id="intelligence-analytics">Intelligence &amp; Analytics</h2>

<p>Intelligence &amp; Analytics is the process of analyzing information about situations and entities of strategic, operational or tactical importance to categorize the known and, with appropriate statements of probability, uncover future actions by those entities.</p>

<p>The descriptions are drawn from what may only be available in the form of deliberately deceptive information. Thus, the analyst must correlate the similarities among deceptions and extract a common truth. Although, this practice is found in its purest form inside national intelligence agencies, these methods are also applicable in the fields of business or competitive intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="environment-analysis-signal-to-noise">Environment Analysis: Signal to Noise</h2>

<p>Environment Analysis, or “Signal to Noise,” assessment is one of the most important responsibilities of the information security professional, to ensure management has the sufficient data to make well-informed business decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Certification Programme</strong></p>

<p>Eagle Eye Systems Asia Ltd offers Certification of Achievement Awards for a select number of essential skills or services demanded by best practice policies and procedures within the IT industry, with the assistance of skilled and experienced industry instructors.</p>

<p><strong>Business Continuity Plans</strong></p>

<p>As defined by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission in June 2014, licensed corporations are expected to “establish and maintain appropriate internal controls and risk management measures to protect your key business functions and recover them in a timely fashion in the event of operational disruptions,” the SFC states.</p>
