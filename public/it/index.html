<h2 id="ees-asia-s-security-awareness-training-teaches-staff-how-to-adapt-behaviour-to-lower-attack-risk">EES Asia’s Security Awareness Training Teaches Staff How to Adapt Behaviour to Lower Attack Risk</h2>

<p>Eagle Eye Systems Asia Ltd not only tests the effectiveness of security operations, we also offer employee awareness training programmes with the goal of aligning technology, employees and processes to collectively work towards blocking cyber threats.</p>

<p>Indeed, high-profile cyber security breaches often occur when hackers target an organisation’s weakest link—its staff.</p>

<p>Over-reliance on technology and failure to apply the human factor leaves companies exposed to attacks, leading to the loss of valuable intellectual property, reputation and eats in to the bottom line. From the IT trenches to the C-suite, the right people need to be organised in the right way to make security programmes work. Three areas that deserve the attention of the boards of directors and CEO’s are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="expertise-and-staffing">Expertise and Staffing</h2>

<p>Accept that you will be compromised. A “win” in the cyber-threat environment is defined by how quickly and effectively your company is able to respond to hacks and extricate them from your IT systems.</p>

<p>This requires a significant level of manpower and expertise on a daily basis, but there is no substitute for taking such action in today’s high risk environment. A properly organised and staffed security team requires people with a variety of skills and certifications to deploy the technologies, understand the threats, determine hacker motives, fix vulnerabilities, and deflect attacks.</p>

<p>“44 per cent of organisations say they are dissatisfied with investment in cyber security technology because they lack the in-house expertise to leverage it,” according to a 2015 study by the Ponemon Institute.</p>

<p>To overcome this shortfall, many of our clients are optimizing their existing human resources by outsourcing the expertise and operations that a mature IT security strategy requires.</p>

<p>Security leaders need these management skills to set up the appropriate processes and procedures, advocate for security requirements, and communicate risk to corporate leaders. Defensive technologies cannot be used to their full potential without highly skilled people who can transform data into actionable intelligence.</p>

<p>Database-Laptops-Manikins1024x685.jpg</p>

<h2 id="leadership-and-accountability">Leadership and Accountability</h2>

<p>Communicating cyber security priorities is no longer the job of just the IT team. It requires management to set the tone, support agreed-upon mitigation strategies, and educate their employees about the cyber security risks to understand risk tolerance.</p>

<p>Business enablement often trumps IT network security in the interest of going to market quickly, but only business leaders can ensure that the necessary checks and balances are established to hold management and employees accountable.</p>

<h2 id="awareness-and-training">Awareness and Training</h2>

<p>An informed and vigilant workforce is one of the most important defences against cyberattacks. Hackers know that most workers tend to be helpful and trusting, and hence execute attack strategies that exploit human vulnerabilities. Even boardroom leaders fall prey to socially engineered emails that unleash malicious cyber weapons, targeting the company’s IT network.</p>

<p>An effective “human firewall” is dependent on a culture of vigilance for changing user behaviour to mitigate the risk of attack. The best employee training programmes simulate real-world hackers and provide on-the-spot training when employees fall victim to cybercrime.</p>

<h2 id="cybercrime-is-a-business-risk-hackers-hunt-for-intellectual-property-business-critical-assets">Cybercrime is a business risk: Hackers hunt for intellectual property, business critical assets</h2>

<p>Cybercrime causes “enormous damage” that “not only relates to financial loss but can also lead to long-term and often systemic issues, such as, damage to brands and reputations,” says Kris McConkey, Leader for Cyber Incident Response and Threat Intelligence, in this video produced by PwC.</p>

<p>“Cybercrime is a truly global phenomenon with all geographies being affected. Over a quarter of our survey respondents suffered some sort of incident, and many of those who claimed to have escaped probably did not. They are just not aware of it.</p>

<p>“Cybercrime is permeating every industry, even those who thought themselves immune in the past.”</p>

<p>Traditionally, the hackers were keen to steal cash and credit card information, now they are also interested in acquiring intellectual property and other business critical assets, Mr McConkey asserts.</p>
