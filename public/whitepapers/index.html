<h2 id="corporate-counsel-departments-are-urged-to-prepare-for-inevitable-cyber-attacks-in-alm-legal-intelligence-study">Corporate counsel departments are urged to prepare for “inevitable” cyber attacks in ALM Legal Intelligence study</h2>

<p>The majority of big companies have been hacked and may not even be aware of the breach that is estimated to cost on average US$6.5 million, while the pay outs have accumulated to billions of US dollars since 2014, including Anthem at between $100 million and $16 billion, and JPMorgan Chase at $1 billion dollars, according to US federal authorities and cyber security experts.</p>

<p>Faced with an uptick in cyber security attacks and potential costs, corporations and their legal departments are starting to heighten preventive awareness and improve detection after being hacked, says a research paper by three senior analysts at ALM Legal Intelligence.</p>

<p>“Meeting the threat necessitates involving legal departments more deeply in the formation of policy and process from the outset. Cyber security challenges are explored in depth in this research, including an overview of the current state of the cyber security landscape, the role of in-house counsel, company benchmarks, and analysis of where industries appear to be headed to meet current and impending threats.</p>

<p>“This research reveals why cyber security matters to each and every company and the ways companies and corporate counsel departments can prepare for and react to inevitable cyber attacks,” the authors of the research paper warn.</p>

<h2 id="prevention-systems-alone-are-insufficient-to-combat-hard-core-hacks-sans-whitepaper">Prevention systems alone are insufficient to combat hard-core hacks: SANS Whitepaper</h2>

<p>“The chances are very high that hidden threats are already in your organisation’s networks. Organisations can’t afford to believe that their security measures are perfect and impenetrable, no matter how thorough their security precautions might be,” according to a SANS Institute Whitepaper by Robert M. Lee and Rob Lee, entitled, ‘The Who, What, Where, When, Why and How of Effective Threat Hunting.’</p>

<p>“Having a perimeter and defending it are not enough because the perimeter has faded away as new technologies and interconnected devices have emerged. Prevention systems alone are insufficient to counter focused human adversaries who know how to get around most security and monitoring tools by, for example, making their attacks look like normal activity,” the authors of the Whitepaper state.</p>

<p>“Prevention systems and tools help reduce opportunities for adversaries and enable analysts to operate more effectively. The key, however, is to constantly look for attacks that get past security systems and to catch intrusions in progress rather than after attackers have completed their objectives and done worse damage to the business.</p>

<p>“This process is referred to as “cyber threat hunting.” Many organisations today do some type of formal or informal hunting. For example, rather than waiting for the “you’ve been breached” notification, they are intermittently or constantly searching through their own networks for evidence of threat activity.”</p>

<h2 id="four-approaches-to-critical-incident-response-selecting-the-best-fit-solutionary-whitepaper">Four Approaches to Critical Incident Response: Selecting the Best Fit: Solutionary Whitepaper</h2>

<p>Even those in the security business know preventive security measures are not enough to stop malware infiltrations and other security threats completely, according to a whitepaper produced by Solutionary, an NTT Group Security Company.</p>

<p>“It’s only a matter of when not if an organisation is breached in some manner. A data breach, a malware outbreak, a successful hacker infiltration, a DDoS attack…many have experience trying to slay one of these cyber dragons, while others have yet to deal with one, or may not even know they’ve suffered from an incident,” the authors of the executive brief highlight.</p>

<p>“When calculating security spending, most organisations emphasize security controls to a much greater extent than monitoring and incident response. Bringing more balance to this spending ratio and a more proactive approach to critical incident response could mean the difference between crippling after-effects of a breach and a manageable effort to thwart attacks and properly investigate.</p>

<p>“Taking a proactive approach to incident response can drastically improve an organisation’s security posture. Security frameworks and some compliance mandates also require organisations to have a security programme and an incident response plan.</p>

<p>“While every enterprise may strive for a mature incident response plan backed by a skilled security operations team, this is not a realistic goal for many organisations. Is it possible to still identify, contain and mitigate an attack without the most robust incident response plan and team in place? Yes, to a degree.</p>

<p>“Successful incident response largely depends on creating a customized incident response plan that is realistic and manageable, then training and preparing employees and practicing the steps outlined in the plan.”</p>

<p>The whitepaper briefly outlines four approaches to help an organisation determine its incident response capabilities and recommends measures to implement to be best prepared to contend with a security breach.</p>

<h2 id="legal-sector-plays-catch-up-in-understanding-implementing-corporate-cyber-security-imperative-alm-legal-intelligence">Legal sector plays “catch-up” in understanding, implementing corporate cyber security imperative: ALM Legal Intelligence</h2>

<p>“Confronted with an uptick in cyber attacks and the increasing demands of their clients, law firms are scrambling to come to terms with an evolving cybersecurity landscape that not only poses an unprecedented, existential threat to the confidentiality and trust inherent in the attorney-client relationship, but also presents new revenue opportunities for the practice of law around issues related to data, privacy and information security.”</p>

<p>“Nearly 10 per cent of firms have not performed a formal information, security and privacy assessment. Approximately one-third of firms do not hold cyber liability insurance policies. More than 55 per cent of firms have either already established a cybersecurity practice or have plans to form one,” according to a research report by ALM Legal Intelligence, entitled, ‘Cybersecurity and Law Firms: Ignorance Is Risk.’</p>

<p>“Overall, the report presents a picture of an industry trying to play catch-up in understanding both the risks and opportunities presented by corporate cybersecurity imperatives,” conclude the authors of the study: Senior Analysts Steven Kovalan, Daniella Isaacson and Nicholas Bruch.</p>

<p>“As the report also details, law firms that invest in building credible expertise in cybersecurity have an opportunity to gain competitive advantage — but the window for capitalizing on this burgeoning new area of the law is closing quickly.”</p>

<p>Drawing from the results of the inaugural ALM Legal Intelligence Law Firm Cybersecurity Survey, the report consists of three sections: Law Firms and the Cyber Threat Environment: An Overview;</p>

<p>Fulfilling Due Care and Pursuing Best Practices; and Cyber Opportunity, Data, Privacy and Information Security as a Practice Area.</p>

<p>In addition, the report contains a set of tools that introduces cybersecurity best practices, overviews the current regulatory environment, and lists cybersecurity trends to monitor.</p>
